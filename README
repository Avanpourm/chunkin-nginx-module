This module attempts to add HTTP 1.1 chunked transfer
encoding support for request bodies to nginx 0.8.x and
0.7.x without patching nginx.

It's not working yet but progressing *very* rapidly. So
go watching it!

Usage:

    chunkin on;
    location /foo {
        # your normal config goes here...
    }

That is, the only directive provided by this module is
"chunkin".
