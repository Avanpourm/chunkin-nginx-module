Name
    chunkin-nginx-module - HTTP 1.1 chunked-encoding request body support
    for Nginx.

    *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the
    installation instructions.

Version
    This document describes chunkin-nginx-module v0.06
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/downloads>) released on
    Nov 16, 2009.

Synopsis
      chunkin on;
      location { ... }
      ...

Description
    This module adds HTTP 1.1 chunked
    (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.6.1>) input support for
    Nginx without the need of patching the Nginx core.

    Behind the scene, it registers an access-phase handler that will eagerly
    read and decode incoming request bodies when a "Transfer-Encoding:
    chunked" header triggers a 411 error page in Nginx (hey, that's what you
    have to pay for avoiding patching the core ;)). For requests that are
    not in the "chunked" transfer encoding, this module is a "no-op".

    To enable the magic, just turn on the "chunkin" config option like this:

        chunkin on;
        location /foo { ... }
        ....

    No other modification is required in your nginx.conf file and everything
    should work out of the box including the standard proxy module (except
    for those known issues). Note that the "chunkin" directive is not
    allowed in the location block BTW.

    The core module's client_body_buffer_size, client_max_body_size, and
    client_body_timeout directive settings are honored.

    The client_body_in_file_only and client_body_in_single_buffer settings
    are followed partially. See Know Issues.

    WARNING: This module is in its very early phase in development and is
    considered *highly experimental*. But you're encouraged to play and test
    it in your non-production environment and report any quirks that you
    find.

    Efforts have been made to reduce data copying and dynamic memory
    allocation, thus unfortunately raising the risk of potential buffer
    handling bugs caused by premature optimizations :P

    This module is not supposed to be merged into the Nginx core because
    I've used Ragel to generate the chunked encoding parser for joy :)

Directives
  chunkin
    syntax: *chunkin on|off*

    default: *off*

    context: *http, server*

    Enables or disables this module's hooks.

Installation
    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
    example, the version 0.8.28 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
    the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.28.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.28.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.28/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/chunkin-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    chunkin-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/downloads>).

  For Developers
    The chunked parser is generated by Ragel
    (<http://www.complang.org/ragel/>). If you want to regenerate the
    parser's C file, i.e., src/chunked_parser.c
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/src/chunked
    _parser.c>), use the following command from the root of the chunkin
    module's source tree:

        $ ragel -G2 src/chunked_parser.rl

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested version is 0.8.28)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.21 (last tested version is 0.7.64)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.21 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

Report Bugs
    Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
    there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
    whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to

    1.  send a bug report or even patches to <agentzh@gmail.com>,

    2.  or create a ticket on the issue tracking interface
        (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/issues>) provided
        by GitHub.

Source Repository
    Available on github at agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module>).

ChangeLog
  v0.06
    *   minor optimization: we won't traverse the output chain link if the
        chain count is not large enough.

Test Suite
    This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The test cases
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/tree/master/test/t/>)
    are declarative
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/test/t/sani
    ty.t>) too. Thanks to the Test::Base
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base>) module in the Perl world.

    To run it on your side:

        $ cd test
        $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-chunkin-module:$PATH prove -r t

    You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite
    if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

    At the moment, LWP::UserAgent
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::UserAgent>) is used by the test
    scaffold
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/test/lib/Te
    st/Nginx/LWP.pm>) for simplicity.

    Because a single nginx server (by default, "localhost:1984") is used
    across all the test scripts (".t" files), it's meaningless to run the
    test suite in parallel by specifying "-jN" when invoking the "prove"
    utility.

    Some parts of the test suite requires modules proxy and echo to be
    enabled as well when building Nginx.

Known Issues
    *   May not work properly if keep-alive is enabled in Nginx. Use it with
        keep-alive at your own risk.

    *   May not work with certain 3rd party modules like the upload module
        (<http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/upload.en.html>) because it
        implements its own request body reading mechanism.

    *   "client_body_in_single_buffer on" may *not* be obeyed for short
        contents and fast network.

    *   "client_body_in_file_only on" may *not* be obeyed for short contents
        and fast network.

TODO
    *   Fix the known issues.

    *   Add support for trailers and chunked extensions as specified in the
        RFC (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.6.1>)

    *   Add tests for invalid chunked input by implementing
        Test::Nginx::Socket in the test scaffold.

Getting involved
