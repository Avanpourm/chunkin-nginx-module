Name
    chunkin-nginx-module - HTTP 1.1 chunked-encoding request body support
    for Nginx.

    *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the
    installation instructions.

Version
    This document describes chunkin-nginx-module v0.08
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/downloads>) released on
    Dec 6, 2009.

Synopsis
      chunkin on;
      location { ... }
      ...

      chunkin on;
      location {
        chunkin_keepalive on;
        ...
      }

Description
    This module adds HTTP 1.1 chunked
    (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.6.1>) input support for
    Nginx without the need of patching the Nginx core.

    Behind the scene, it registers an access-phase handler that will eagerly
    read and decode incoming request bodies when a "Transfer-Encoding:
    chunked" header triggers a 411 error page in Nginx (hey, that's what you
    have to pay for avoiding patching the core ;)). For requests that are
    not in the "chunked" transfer encoding, this module is a "no-op".

    To enable the magic, just turn on the "chunkin" config option like this:

        chunkin on;
        location /foo { ... }
        ....

    No other modification is required in your nginx.conf file and everything
    should work out of the box including the standard proxy module (except
    for those known issues). Note that the "chunkin" directive is not
    allowed in the location block BTW.

    The core module's client_body_buffer_size, client_max_body_size, and
    client_body_timeout directive settings are honored.

    The client_body_in_file_only and client_body_in_single_buffer settings
    are followed partially. See Know Issues.

    WARNING: This module is in its very early phase in development and is
    considered *experimental*. But you're encouraged to play and test it in
    your environment and report any quirks that you find.

    This module is not supposed to be merged into the Nginx core because
    I've used Ragel (<http://www.complang.org/ragel/>) to generate the
    chunked encoding parser for joy :)

  How it works
    Nginx explicitly checks chunked "Transfer-Encoding" headers and absent
    content length header in its very early phase. Well, as early as the
    "ngx_http_process_request_header" function. So this module takes a
    rather tricky approach. That is, use an output filter to intercept the
    "411 Length Required" error page response issued by
    "ngx_http_process_request_header", fix things and finally issue an
    internal redirect to the current location, thus starting from those
    phases we all know and love, this time bypassing the horrible
    "ngx_http_process_request_header" function.

    In the "rewrite" phase of the newly created request, this module eagerly
    reads in the chunked request body in a way similar to that of the
    standard "ngx_http_read_client_request_body" function, but using its own
    chunked parser generated by Ragel. The decoded request body will be put
    into "r->request_body->bufs" and a corresponding "Content-Length" header
    will be inserted into "r->headers_in".

    Those modules using the standard "ngx_http_read_client_request_body"
    function to read the request body will just work out of box because
    "ngx_http_read_client_request_body" returns immediately when it sees
    "r->request_body->bufs" already exists.

    Special efforts have been made to reduce data copying and dynamic memory
    allocation, thus unfortunately raising the risk of potential buffer
    handling bugs caused by premature optimizations :P

Directives
  chunkin
    syntax: *chunkin on|off*

    default: *off*

    context: *http, server*

    Enables or disables this module's hooks.

  chunkin_keepalive
    syntax: *chunkin_keepalive on|off*

    default: *off*

    context: *http, server, location, if*

    Turns on or turns off HTTP 1.1 keep-alive and HTTP 1.1 pipelining
    support.

    Keep-alive without pipelining should be quite stable but pipelining
    support is very preliminary, limited, and almost untested.

    This directive was first introduced in the v0.07 release.

    Technical note on the HTTP 1.1 pipeling support

    The basic idea is to copy the bytes left by my chunked parser in
    "r->request_body->buf" over into "r->header_in" so that nginx's
    "ngx_http_set_keepalive" and "ngx_http_init_request" functions will pick
    it up for the subsequent pipelined requests. When the request body is
    small enough to be completely preread into the "r->header_in" buffer,
    then no data copy is needed here -- just setting "r->header_in->pos"
    correctly will suffice.

    The only issue that remains is how to enlarge "r->header_in" when the
    data left in "r->request_body->buf" is just too large to be hold in the
    remaining room between "r->header_in->pos" and "r->header_in->end". For
    now, this module will just give up and simply turn off "r->keepalive".

    I know we can always use exactly the remaining room in "r->header_in" as
    the buffer size when reading data from "c->recv", but's suboptimal when
    the remaining room in "r->header_in" happens to be very small while
    "r->request_body->buf" is quite large.

    I haven't fully grokked all the details among "r->header_in",
    "c->buffer", busy/free lists and those so-called "large header buffers".
    Is there a clean and safe way to reallocate or extend the "r->header_in"
    buffer?

Installation
    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
    example, the version 0.8.29 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
    the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.29/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/chunkin-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    chunkin-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/downloads>).

  For Developers
    The chunked parser is generated by Ragel
    (<http://www.complang.org/ragel/>). If you want to regenerate the
    parser's C file, i.e., src/chunked_parser.c
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/src/chunked
    _parser.c>), use the following command from the root of the chunkin
    module's source tree:

        $ ragel -G2 src/chunked_parser.rl

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested version is 0.8.29)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.21 (last tested version is 0.7.64)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.21 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

Report Bugs
    Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
    there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
    whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to

    1.  send a bug report or even patches to <agentzh@gmail.com>,

    2.  or create a ticket on the issue tracking interface
        (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/issues>) provided
        by GitHub.

ChangeLog
  v0.08
    *   fixed gcc compilation errors on x86_64, thanks J for report it.

    *   used the latest Ragel 6.6 to generate the "chunked_parser.c" file in
        the source tree.

  v0.07
    *   marked the disgarded 411 error page's output chain bufs as consumed
        by setting "buf->pos = buf->last". (See this nginx-devel thread
        (<http://nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2009-December/000025.html>)
        for more details.)

    *   added the chunkin_keepalive directive which can enable HTTP 1.1
        keep-alive and HTTP 1.1 pipelining, and defaults to "off".

    *   fixed the "alphtype" bug in the Ragel parser spec; which caused
        rejection of non-ascii octets in the chunked data. Thanks J for his
        bug report.

    *   added "Test::Nginx::Socket" to test our nginx module on the socket
        level. Thanks J for his bug report.

    *   rewrote the bufs recycling part and preread-buf-to-rb-buf transition
        part, also refactored the Ragel parser spec, thus eliminating lots
        of serious bugs.

    *   provided better diagnostics in the error log message for "bad
        chunked body" parsefails in the chunked parser. For example:

     2009/12/02 17:35:52 [error] 32244#0: *1 bad chunked body (offset 7, near "4^M
     hell <-- HERE o^M
     0^M
     ^M
     ", marked by " <-- HERE ").
     , client: 127.0.0.1, server: localhost, request: "POST /main
    HTTP/1.1", host: "localhost"

    *   added some code to let the chunked parser handle special 0-size
        chunks that are not the last chunk.

    *   fixed a connection leak bug regarding incorrect "r->main->count"
        reference counter handling for nginx 0.8.11+ (well, the
        "ngx_http_read_client_request_body" function in the nginx core also
        has this issue, I'll report it later.)

  v0.06
    *   minor optimization: we won't traverse the output chain link if the
        chain count is not large enough.

Test Suite
    This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The test cases
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/tree/master/test/t/>)
    are declarative
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/test/t/sani
    ty.t>) too. Thanks to the Test::Base
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base>) module in the Perl world.

    To run it on your side:

        $ cd test
        $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-chunkin-module:$PATH prove -r t

    You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite
    if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

    At the moment, LWP::UserAgent
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::UserAgent>) is used by the test
    scaffold
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module/blob/master/test/lib/Te
    st/Nginx/LWP.pm>) for simplicity.

    Because a single nginx server (by default, "localhost:1984") is used
    across all the test scripts (".t" files), it's meaningless to run the
    test suite in parallel by specifying "-jN" when invoking the "prove"
    utility.

    Some parts of the test suite requires modules proxy and echo to be
    enabled as well when building Nginx.

Known Issues
    *   May not work with certain 3rd party modules like the upload module
        (<http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/upload.en.html>) because it
        implements its own request body reading mechanism.

    *   "client_body_in_single_buffer on" may *not* be obeyed for short
        contents and fast network.

    *   "client_body_in_file_only on" may *not* be obeyed for short contents
        and fast network.

    *   HTTP 1.1 pipelining may not fully work yet.

TODO
    *   Fix the known issues.

    *   Add support for trailers and chunked extensions as specified in the
        RFC (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.6.1>)
