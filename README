This module attempts to add HTTP 1.1 chunked transfer
encoding support for request bodies to nginx 0.8.x and
0.7.x without patching nginx.

Status

Mostly working now except:

1. You will see the harmless "zero size buf in output"
   alert in your error log.

2. "client_body_in_single_buffer on" may *not* be obeyed
   for short contents and fast network.

3. "client_body_in_file_only on" may *not* be obeyed
   for short contents and fast network.

Usage:

    chunkin on;
    location /foo {
        # your normal config goes here...
    }

That is, the only directive provided by this module is
"chunkin".

To build this module with your nginx:

    $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.24.tar.gz'
    $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.24.tar.gz
    $ cd nginx-0.8.24/

    # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
        --add-module=/path/to/chunkin-nginx-module

    $ make -j2
    $ make install

The chunked parser is actually generated by Ragel. If you want to
regenerate the parser's C file, i.e., src/chunked_parser.c, use
the following command:

    $ ragel -G2 src/chunked_parser.rl
